# Backgrounds-and-borders-assessment

For the first task we have to:
1.Give the box a 5px black solid border, with rounded corners of 10px;
2.Add a background image (use the URL balloons.jpg) and size it so that it covers the box;
3.Give the <h2> a semi-transparent black background color, and make the text white.
  
  
  
  
For the second task we have to:
1.Give the box a 5px lightblue border, and round the top left corner 20px and the bottom right corner 40px;
2.The heading uses the star.png image as a background image, with a single centered star on the left and a repeating pattern of stars on the right;
3.Make sure that the heading text does not overlay the image, and that it is centered â€” you will need to use techniques learned in previous lessons to achieve this.
